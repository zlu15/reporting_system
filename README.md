# Antra Final Evaluation Assessment #1

### Environment
In order to compile and run this assessment correctly, below environments are required:

* Java JDK 11+
* Maven
* Also you may need software to view the generated Excel files like Microsoft Office, LibreOffice, WPS, Google Doc etc.

### Objectives
To evaluate the candidates':
 * Java Coding proficiency.
 * Object oriented design.
 * Design and implementation of REST webservices/endpoints.
 * Basic compiling, packaging, building skill.
 * Testing skill.
 * Debug and issue fixing skill.
 * Code format and conventions.
 
 ### Install
 ####- Run the below command to compile and setup:
 * _`mvn install`_
  * or _`mvn install -Dmaven.test.skip=true`_ if the test fails during the building.
 ####- Run the below command to run the tests:
 * _`mvn test`_

 
 ### Project Explaination
 This project is simulating REST apis for the generation of Excel Files from user customizable data.
 The format of incoming data is not pre-defined, which means the user should pass data for each row and column. APIs are including: 
  * Generate Excel Files and store the files on the server for further downloading.
  * Excel Files could have 2 flavors: single sheet and multi-sheet.
  * User data should indicate which header to be used to split the data into multiple sheet.
  * An API for list and search excel files.
  * You can decide what meta data you need for the excel like generatedTime, filename, filesize.
  * An id is required for each generated file, of course.
  * Delete file by id.
  
#### See [ExcelReportSystem.pdf](ExcelReportSystem.pdf) for more details.
  
 ####Valid incoming data
 * For single sheet api - _fields may vary depending on your design._
 ```json
 {"headers":["Name","Age"], "data":[["Teresa","5"],["Daniel","1"]]}
 ```
 * For auto split sheet api _- fields may vary depending on your design._
```json
{"headers":["Name","Age","Class"], "data":[["Teresa","5","A"],["Daniel","1","B"]], "splitBy":"Class"}
```
 * See _ExcelGenerationController_ for Detailed explaination of each API.

####Data storage
 * Using ConcurrentHashMap to simulate data storage in _"[ExcelRepository](src/main/java/com/antra/evaluation/reporting_system/repo/ExcelRepositoryImpl.java)"_.

###Documents
* [ExcelReportSystem.pdf](ExcelReportSystem.pdf)

###Test
You can use [mathData.json](mathData.json) and [mathData-withSplitBy.json](mathData-withSplitBy.json) as the payload when testing with Postman or Junit.
[mathData.xlsx](mathData.xlsx) and [mathData-withSplitBy.xlsx](mathData-withSplitBy.xlsx) are two example excel files for the test data.


###Optional - Challenge your self
* Add batch generation api that can accept multiple data as the same time and generate multiple excel at once.
* Add batch downloading api that allow user to download multiple files in one request. Downloaded File should be in zip format.
